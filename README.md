Overall: my project is a virtual stock trade webpage. My intentions and idea behind it is to make a webpage that would be similar to a
stock trading webpage that is a place for beginners or even young people to start to learn about training and a place where people can get there
first experience with trading.

after you register you will get $10000 to trade for, and you can earn more money by either trading and earn profit or completing challenges.
the rest is described on the help apge that I have copied in here:


HELP AND INFORMATION
Home page
Your home page shows information about all the stocks you own. Additionally, the home page display the amount of cash you have available for in the market,
your total assets and your profit in both cash and percent. To access the home page, click the VAL$treet logo in the top left corner.

Search
In search, you can find stock that are updated in our database. All you have to do is search for the name of the company you want to find or some part
of the name of the company, and our search engine will do the job. You can see the name, symbol, current price and when the stock was last updated.

Our seaech engine is improved by user activity. If you can´t find a stock in our database, please help us improve our database by looking up the
ticker (1-5 letter symbol) of the stock of the company you want to lookup. If you search for the ticker in our search engine, it will automatically
be added to our database. please help us by doing so if we don´t have a company.

On our search page, you can easily see the top 10 most searched stocks in our database. If you click "show all", you´ll be able to see the whole database.
It can be overwelming, so please search for the stock if you can´t find it easily.

Buy
All you have to do to buy a stock is to enter the symbol/ticker of the stock and the amount of shares you want to buy.
if the transaction is successful, you will be directed to the index page and you´ll be able to see the stock. To find the symbol of the stock,
search for the stock in on the search page

Sell
The process of selling a stock is fairly simple; you choose the stock you want to sell from the select menu and enter the amount of shares you want to sell.
You can see the stock and shares you own on the page to make good decisions.

History
In history, you can see all your transactions. When you enter the page, you can see the last 10 transactions you´ve made, if you click "show all",
you´ll be able to see all your transactions.

Leaderboard
VAL$treet also have a leaderboard that keeps track of all users profit and rank them accordingly. The leaderboard is ranked by profit in percent.
You can see your rank, plus top 10. If you click "show all", you can see the whole table.

Challenges
In Challenges there is a list of challenges that you can complete to earn more cash. The cash will automatically be added to your account if you
complete the challenge. Each challenge can only be completed once. The challenge page will keep track of which challenge you have completed.

Keep in mind that when you receive cash after completing your challenge, you will receive more money in your account, which means your profit
will go down. An example of this is that if you´ve made $1100 from your original $10000, and you earn $1000, your overall profit
will go down from 11% to 10%
